Exchange Surfaces

How easily stuff moves between an organism and its environment depends on its surface area to volume ratio.

Organisms Exchange Substances with their Environment

    Cells can use diffusion to take in substances they need and get rid of waste products. For example:
        Oxygen and carbon dioxide are transferred between cells and the environment during gas exchange.
        In humans, urea (a waste product produced from the breakdown of proteins, see p.75) diffuses from cells into the blood plasma for removal from the body by the kidneys.

    How easy it is for an organism to exchange substances with its environment depends on the organism's surface area to volume ratio (SA : V).

You Can Compare Surface Area to Volume Ratios A ratio shows how big one value is compared to another. The larger an organism is, the smaller its surface area is compared to its volume. You can show this by calculating surface area to volume ratios:

A hippo can be represented by a 2 cm x 4 cm x 4 cm block. Surface area to volume ratio: 4:1 The area of a surface is found by the equation: LENGTH x WIDTH So the hippo's total surface area is:

    (4 cm×2 cm)×2(4 cm×2 cm)×2 (top and bottom surfaces of the block) +
    (4 cm×4 cm)×2(4 cm×4 cm)×2 (four sides of the block)

Image description: A diagram showing the calculation of surface area to volume ratio for a rectangular block representing a hippo. The block is labeled with dimensions 2 cm by 4 cm by 4 cm, and the surface area calculation is detailed as above, with a final ratio of 4:1.

The volume of a block is found by the equation: LENGTH x WIDTH x HEIGHT So the hippo's volume is 4 x 4 x 2 = 32 cm³

The surface area to volume ratio of the hippo can be written as 64323264​. So to simplify the ratio, divide both sides of the ratio by the volume. The surface area to volume ratio of the hippo can be 64323264​: 2:1.

A mouse can be represented by a 1 cm x 1 cm x 1 cm block. Surface area to volume ratio: 6:1 Its surface area is (1 cm×1 cm)×6(1 cm×1 cm)×6 = 6 cm². Its volume is 1 cm×1 cm×1 cm1 cm×1 cm×1 cm = 1 cm³. So the surface area to volume ratio of the mouse is 6116​: 6:1.

Image description: A comparison of surface area to volume ratios between a mouse and a hippo. The mouse's surface area is six times the volume, but the hippo's surface area is only twice the volume. So the mouse has a larger surface area compared to its volume.

Multicellular Organisms Need Exchange Surfaces

    In single-celled organisms, gases and dissolved substances can diffuse directly into (or out of) the cell across the cell membrane. It's because they have a large surface area compared to their volume, so enough substances can be exchanged across the membrane to supply the volume of the cell.

    Multicellular organisms have a smaller surface area compared to their volume — not enough substances can diffuse from their outside surface to supply their entire volume. This means they need some sort of exchange surface for efficient diffusion (see pages 24-25 for some examples).

    Exchange surfaces have features to allow enough of the necessary substances to pass through. Exchange surfaces are ADAPTED to maximise effectiveness:
        They have a thin membrane, so substances only have a short distance to diffuse.
        They have a large surface area so lots of a substance can diffuse at once.
        Exchange surfaces in animals have lots of blood vessels, to get stuff into and out of the blood quickly.
        Gas exchange surfaces in animals (e.g., alveoli) are often ventilated too — air moves in and out.
