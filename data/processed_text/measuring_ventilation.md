**Tidal Volume is the Volume of Air in a Normal Breath**

Here are some terms that you need to know about breathing:

1. **Tidal volume (TV)** — the volume of air in each breath — usually about 0.4 dm³.
2. **Vital capacity** — the maximum volume of air that can be breathed in or out.
3. **Breathing rate** — how many breaths are taken — usually in a minute.
4. **Oxygen consumption or oxygen uptake** — the rate at which an organism uses up oxygen (e.g., the number of dm³ used per minute).

*Image Description:*
A chart illustrates the volume of gas in dm³ against time in seconds. The chart has a repeating pattern indicating the process of normal breathing: a deep breath in raises the volume sharply, followed by a decrease for a normal breath out, then another increase for a deep breath in and a sharp decrease for a deep breath out. There is a shaded area under the curve labeled as 'tidal volume of normal breath', and a baseline labeled 'residual air can't be expelled'. An annotated diagram on the right side of the page shows a vertical cross-section of the lungs, indicating 'tidal volume of normal breath' and 'vital capacity of the lungs'.

**Spirometers Can be Used to Investigate Breathing**

A spirometer is a machine that can give readings of tidal volume, vital capacity, breathing rate, and oxygen uptake.

1. A spirometer has an oxygen-filled chamber with a movable lid.
2. The person breathes through a tube connected to the oxygen chamber.
3. As the person breathes in and out, the lid of the chamber moves up and down.
4. These movements can be recorded by a pen attached to the lid of the chamber — this writes on a rotating drum, creating a spirometer trace. Or the spirometer can be hooked up to a motion sensor — this will use the movements to produce electronic signals, which are picked up by a data logger.
5. The soda lime in the tube the subject breathes into absorbs carbon dioxide.

The total volume of gas in the chamber decreases over time. This is because the air that’s breathed out is a mixture of oxygen and carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide is absorbed by the soda lime — so there’s only oxygen in the chamber which the subject inhales from. As this oxygen gets used up by respiration, the total volume decreases.

The image shows a diagram of a spirometer. It has labeled parts including the pen that writes the spirometer trace, a rotating drum, the lid of the chamber that moves up and down, the oxygen chamber, inhaled and exhaled air directions, the tube the subject breathes in and out from, soda lime, and a valve that makes inhaled and exhaled air go in different directions.

**You Need to be Able to Analyse Data from a Spirometer**

In the exam, you might have to work out breathing rate, tidal volume, vital capacity, and oxygen consumption from a spirometer trace. For example:

*Image Description:*
A graph displays the volume of gas in a spirometer in dm³ against time in minutes. The graph has a series of peaks and troughs consistent with breathing in and out. Notable points on the graph are labeled as 'oxygen consumption in one minute', 'vital capacity', and 'tidal volume'.

1. In this trace, the breathing rate in the first minute is 10 breaths per minute (there are 10 'peaks' in the first minute).
2. The tidal volume may change from time to time, but in this trace it's about 0.5 dm³.
3. The graph shows a vital capacity of 2.65 dm³.
4. Oxygen consumption is the decrease in the volume of gas in the spirometer chamber. It can be read from the graph by taking the average slope of the trace. In this case, it drops by 0.7 dm³ in the first minute — so, the oxygen consumption is 0.7 dm³/min.
