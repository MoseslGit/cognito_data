**Ventilation in Mammals**

*If you’re in need of inspiration then there’s plenty on this page... sadly I’m only talking about the kind of inspiration that gets air into your lungs — if you want the other sort head over to the Grand Canyon.*

**Ventilation in Mammals is Breathing In and Out**

*Ventilation consists of inspiration (breathing in) and expiration (breathing out). It’s controlled by the movements of the diaphragm, internal and external intercostal muscles and ribcage.*

**Inspiration**

1. The external intercostal and diaphragm muscles contract.
2. This causes the ribcage to move upwards and outwards and the diaphragm to flatten, increasing the volume of the thorax (the space where the lungs are).
3. As the volume of the thorax increases the lung pressure decreases (to below atmospheric pressure).
4. This causes air to flow into the lungs.
5. Inspiration is an active process — it requires energy.

**Expiration**

1. The external intercostal and diaphragm muscles relax.
2. The ribcage moves downwards and inwards and the diaphragm becomes curved again.
3. The thorax volume decreases, causing the air pressure to increase (to above atmospheric pressure).
4. Air is forced out of the lungs.
5. Normal expiration is passive — it doesn’t require energy.
6. Expiration can be forced though (e.g. if you want to blow out the candles on your birthday cake). During forced expiration, the internal intercostal muscles contract, to pull the ribcage down and in.

**Description of the Images:**

- There are several diagrams illustrating the processes of inspiration and expiration.
    - In the inspiration section, diagrams are showing the contraction of the external intercostal muscles and diaphragm, upward and outward movement of the ribcage, flattening of the diaphragm, increase in thorax volume, and airflow into the lungs.
    - In the expiration section, diagrams depict the relaxation of the external intercostal muscles and diaphragm, downward and inward movement of the ribcage, curving of the diaphragm, decrease in thorax volume, and airflow out of the lungs.
