### Lesson: Introduction to Carbohydrates

**Heading: This lesson covers:**

1. The elements that carbohydrates contain
2. The role of carbohydrates in living organisms
3. The different types of carbohydrates

**Header: What are carbohydrates?**

Carbohydrates are biological molecules that contain the elements carbon (C), hydrogen (H), and oxygen (O).

1. 'Carbo' - contains the element carbon.
2. 'hydrate' - contains hydrogen and oxygen atoms in a ratio of 2:1 like water (H2O).

The general formula for a carbohydrate is Cx(H2O)y.

**Header: Roles of carbohydrates**

1. Energy supply for cells - this is the main role of carbohydrates.
2. Energy storage - sugars can be stored as complex carbohydrates (e.g. starch or glycogen).
3. Structural components - cellulose and chitin are used in cell walls.
4. Cellular recognition - glycoproteins help cells identify each other and communicate.
5. Building blocks for biological molecules - deoxyribose and ribose can be used to make nucleic acids.

**Header: Types of carbohydrates** 

There are three types of carbohydrates: monosaccharides, disaccharides, and polysaccharides.

### Lesson: Amino acids & Proteins

**Header: This lesson covers:**

1. The roles of proteins in living organisms
2. The structure of amino acids
3. The synthesis and breakdown of peptide bonds
4. How to test for proteins

**Header: Proteins are made up of amino acids**

Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins, which are essential macromolecules involved in various functions within living organisms.

Amino acids are monomers and can join together via peptide bonds to form dimers (dipeptides) and polymers (polypeptides).

*Image description: Table highlighting that amino acids are monomer, dipeptides of dimers and polypeptides and polymers. It also contains a simplified diagram of each to show that they consist of 1, 2 or many units.* 

**Header: What are the roles of proteins?**

1. Enzymes - used to breakdown and synthesise molecules.
2. Antibodies - involved in the immune response.
3. Transport - move molecules or ions across membranes.
4. Structural components - keratin and collagen are used to create strong fibres.
5. Hormones - act as chemical messengers in the body.
6. Muscle contraction - muscles are made up of proteins.

**Header: Amino acid structure**

There are around 20 different amino acids that are commonly found in living organisms. They all have the same general structure:

*Image description: labelled diagram of an amino acid*

- A central carbon atom
- An amino group (-NH2)
- A carboxyl group (-COOH)
- A hydrogen atom (-H)
- An R group or a variable side group - each amino acid has a different R group which determines its properties. For example, amino acid cysteine contains a sulphur atom in its R group. This allows cysteine to form disulphide bonds.

**Header: Dipeptide synthesis and breakdown**

Dipeptides are synthesised via condensation reactions and broken down via hydrolysis reactions. These reactions involve the formation or the breakdown of a covalent bond known as a peptide bond.

**Header: Condensation reaction**

*Image description: diagram of two amino acids joining together in a condensation reaction to form a dipeptide and water. Highlight the peptide bond and that atoms that make up the water molecule. Include both a diagram and a written equation.* 

When two amino acids join, the hydroxyl (OH) in the carboxyl group of one amino acid reacts with the hydrogen (H) in the amino group of another amino acid. This releases a water molecule (H2O) and forms a peptide bond between the carbon of one amino acid and the nitrogen of another.

**Header: Hydrolysis reaction**

*Image description: diagram of a dipeptide and water reacting together in a hydrolysis reaction to form two amino acids. Include both a diagram and a written equation.* 

When a water molecule (H2O) is added to a dipeptide, the peptide bond is broken to release the 2 amino acids.

**Header: Testing for proteins**
To find out if a sample contains peptide bonds (and hence, proteins), you must carry out the Biuret test:

*Image description: Image showing the steps of the biuret test, so starting with a food sample, then adding Biuret solution, then showing a negative result (blue) and a positive result (purple).* 

1. Place your food sample in a test tube.
2. Add an equal volume of Biuret solution (sodium hydroxide & copper sulfate).
3. If proteins are present, the solution will turn from blue to purple. If no protein is present, the solution remains blue.

### Lesson: Water

**Header: This lesson covers:**

1. The structure of water
2. Hydrogen bonding in water
3. The role of water in living organisms
4. How the properties of water relate to its function

**Header: Structure of water**

A molecule of water (H2O) is made up of one oxygen atom (O) joined to two hydrogen atoms (H). These atoms are held together by 2 covalent bonds.

*Image description: label a covalent bond in a molecule of water. You could show both a dot and cross diagram that shows the electrons, and a displayed formula diagram that shows the line representing the bond.* 

Oxygen shares one electron with each hydrogen atom whilst each hydrogen atom shares its one electron with oxygen.

**Header: Water is a dipolar molecule**
*Image description: diagram of a water molecule that shows the partial positive charges on the hydrogens and the partial negative charge on the oxygen.*  

The shared electrons are pulled towards the oxygen atom, giving the oxygen atom a slightly negative charge δ-. This leaves the hydrogen atoms with a slightly positive charge δ+.

This means that water has both positive and negative poles, making it a dipolar molecule.

**Heading: Water molecules can form hydrogen bonds**

Each water molecule consists of a partially negative oxygen end and a partially positive hydrogen end. This causes water molecules to interact with one another.

The partially positive hydrogen end of one water molecule attracts towards the partially negative oxygen end of another molecule. This force of attraction is known as a hydrogen bond.

*Image description: diagram of some water molecules with hydrogen bonds between them. Label the hydrogen bonds and the water molecules.* 

These hydrogen bonds form between many water molecules, causing them to stick together and giving water some of its useful properties.

**Heading: Roles of water**

Water plays many roles in living organisms including:

1. Solvent - many substances dissolve in water.
2. Temperature control - water can buffer sudden temperature changes.
3. Cooling mechanism - mammals use sweat to cool the skin.
4. Habitat - many organisms can survive and reproduce in water.
5. Metabolite - many chemical reactions involve water.
6. Transport - organisms can use water to move substances.

**Header: Water as a solvent**

Many substances within cells are ionic compounds - this means they consist of positive and negative ions (e.g. salt made up of Na+ and Cl- ions). When these ionic compounds are added to water, the ions get split apart.

*Image description: diagram showing a lattice of sodium chloride being broken up into Na+ and Cl- ions and surrounded by water molecules*

Since water is polar, the slightly negative oxygens are attracted to the positive ions whilst the slightly positive hydrogens are attracted to the negative ions.

Each ion is surrounded by water molecules and the compound dissolves.

Water is known as the universal solvent because it dissolves more substances than any other liquid. This is useful for the following two reasons:

- Most biological reactions take place in solution - e.g. in the cytoplasm of eukaryotes and prokaryotes
- Dissolved substances can be transported around the body - e.g. ions can be transported in the blood plasma

**Header: Water as a temperature buffer**

Water has a high specific heat capacity - this means a lot of energy is needed to raise the temperature of 1 gram of water by 1°C.

This is because the numerous hydrogen bonds between water molecules can absorb a lot of energy before being broken. This means it takes a lot of energy to break the hydrogen bonds and heat the water.

The high specific heat capacity of water means that it is resistant to rapid changes in temperature. Since many organisms are made up of water, this allows the body to remain at a fairly stable temperature.

**Header: Water as a cooling mechanism**

Hydrogen bonding between water molecules also means that a lot of energy is needed to evaporate 1 gram of water.

This means that water has a high latent heat of vaporisation (a high boiling point). A lot of energy is required to break the hydrogen bonds to change it from a liquid to a gas.

This is useful for organisms because they can use evaporation of water as a method of cooling without losing too much water. When water evaporates from the surface of the skin, it takes heat energy away from the surface, cooling the organism down.

**Header: Water as a habitat**

Since water has a high specific heat capacity and a high latent heat of vaporisation, it does not change temperature or evaporate easily. This provides a stable environment for many organisms to live in.

However, at low temperatures, water freezes to form ice. Water molecules are held further apart in ice, making it less dense than water.

This causes ice to float, forming an insulating layer at the surface of ponds and lakes. This means the water below this layer does not freeze, allowing organisms within the water to move and survive.

**Header: Water as a metabolite**

Water is involved in many chemical reactions inside organisms including:

- Hydrolysis reactions - water is used to break down complex molecules.
- Condensation reactions - releases water to join molecules together.
- Photosynthesis - water is used as a raw material.

**Header: Water as a transport medium**

The tendency of water molecules to stick together (via hydrogen bonds) is known as cohesion. Water also has a tendency to stick to other materials - this is known as adhesion.

Strong cohesion and adhesion helps water to flow through organisms, carrying substances along with it.

For example, cohesion and adhesion allow plants to transport water through the xylem in a continuous column.

*Image description: Diagram of a plant with a zoom in box showing some water molecules in a xylem. Label the xylem wall, cohesion between the water molecules, and adhesion between the water molecules and the xylem wall.* 

In the same way, when water molecules meet air they create a high surface tension. This forms a skin-like structure at the surface of the water which is strong enough to support small organisms such as pond-skaters.

### Lesson: Enzyme inhibitors

**Header: This lesson covers:**

1. The different types of inhibitors
2. How competitive inhibitors affect enzyme action
3. How non-competitive inhibitors affect enzyme action

**Header: Types of inhibitors**

Inhibitors are molecules that bind to enzymes to reduce their activity.

The effects of inhibitors can be reversible or irreversible:

- Reversible inhibitors - form weak bonds (e.g. hydrogen or ionic) with the enzyme.
- Irreversible inhibitors - from strong bonds (e.g. covalent) with the enzyme.

**Header: Inhibitors can be grouped into 2 categories:**

1. Competitive inhibitors - bind to the active site.
2. Non-competitive inhibitors - bind to a site away from the active site.

These inhibitors will be covered in more detail later in this lesson.

**Header: Competitive inhibitors**

Competitive inhibitors bind to the active site of an enzyme to prevent enzyme-substrate complexes.

*Image description: Diagram showing that a substrate can bind if there is no competitive inhibitor, but cannot bind if there is a competitor inhibitor.* 

Competitive inhibitors have a similar shape to the substrate and so they bind to the active site of the enzyme. This prevents the substrate from binding, and thus reduces the formation of enzyme-substrate complexes. This results in a decrease in the rate of the enzyme-catalysed reaction.

Most competitive inhibitors are reversible as they only temporarily bind to the enzyme.

**Header: Increasing substrate concentration increases rate of reaction**

Competitive inhibitors can be overcome by increasing the substrate concentration.

*Image description: Graph showing how rate of reaction changes with substrate concentration with and without a competitive inhibitor.* 

The higher the substrate concentration, the more likely it is that substrates will bind to active sites rather than inhibitor molecules. This will reduce the effect of the competitive inhibitor.

**Header: Non-competitive inhibitors**

Non-competitive inhibitors bind to enzymes away from the active site (allosteric site) to prevent enzyme-substrate complexes.

*Image description: Diagram showing that a substrate can bind if there is no non-competitive inhibitor, but cannot bind if there is a non-competive inhibitor. Label the allosteric site where the*  

This binding changes the tertiary structure of the enzyme, causing the active site to change shape.

This results in the active site no longer being complementary to the substrate, thus the substrate and enzyme cannot bind. Less enzyme-substrate complexes are formed and the rate of the enzyme-catalysed reaction decreases.

**Header: Increasing substrate concentration has no effect on the rate of reaction**

Non-competitive inhibitors cannot be overcome by increasing substrate concentration.

*Image description: Graph showing how rate of reaction changes with substrate concentration with and without a non-competitive inhibitor.* 

Non-competitive inhibitors do not compete with the substrate to bind to the active site, so increasing the amount of substrate has no effect on the rate of reaction.

### Lesson title: Enzyme immobilisation

**Header: This lesson covers:**

1. What enzyme immobilisation is
2. The advantages of enzyme immobilisation
3. The example of immobilising lactose to produce lactose-free milk

**Header: What is enzyme immobilisation?**

Enzymes are crucial in various industries such as medicine, food technology, and industrial processing. However, they can be very expensive, which is why companies are finding ways to recycle and reuse enzymes.

One such method is enzyme immobilisation, which involves attaching or enclosing an enzyme onto a solid support or matrix. This allows for the reuse of the enzyme and increases its stability.

**Header: Advantages of immobilising enzymes**

1. Cost-effective - immobilising enzymes allows for the reuse of enzymes, reducing the need to continually purchase new enzymes.
2. Product purity - immobilisation produces enzyme-free products, avoiding contamination of the product with the enzyme.
3. Improved stability - immobilised enzymes are more tolerant of temperature and pH changes than enzymes in solution, making them more stable and less likely to denature.

**Header: Immobilising lactase**

*Image description: Diagram of a column containing lots of beads, with milk flowing through it. Label the beads ‘immobilised lactase’. Label the milk at the top as ‘contains lactose’, and the milk at the bottom as ‘contains glucose and galactose’*

Milk contains lactose, a sugar that some people cannot properly digest. To create lactose-free milk, companies often remove lactose by immobilising the enzyme lactase, which breaks down lactose into glucose and galactose. Here are the steps involved:

1. The lactase enzyme is attached to alginate beads to 'immobilise' it.
2. The lactase-containing beads are packed into a column.
3. Milk is allowed to flow through the column.
4. Lactase breaks down the lactose in the milk into glucose and galactose, producing lactose-free milk.
5. The lactase remains in the column, allowing more milk to be processed continually.
6. The lactose-free milk can then be used to make dairy products for lactose-intolerant individuals.
