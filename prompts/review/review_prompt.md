According to the following checklist, revise and improve your previous lesson
**Checklist**

- Would the student understand this?
- Could this be shorter without sacrificing clarity?
- Could this sentence be made simpler?
- Would the student know what they’re reading about right now? i.e. has it been adequately signposted, or will they not really get what it’s about until they reach the end.?
- Are there any terms here that a student might not understand.
- Would a different layout be better
- Have lists and tables been used to summarise information where possible?
- Are the titles clear and do they signpost properly?
- Does the content of each section flow logically?
- Could we have used diagrams to better explain any of this content?
- Do the art and writing supplement each other, and does the art contain the useful bits of info (e.g. are things labelled, does it highlight the key features etc)
- Is it clear exactly what they should have learnt by the end of a lesson?
